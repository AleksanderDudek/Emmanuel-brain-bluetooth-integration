# Gry treningowe: the arcade games (design)

Eight games built on the band's prefrontal signal: **Geoda**, **Latarnik** and **Motylarnia** (§3),
and **Arka**, **Urodzaj**, **Wzlot**, **Glina** and **Źródła** (§6), all rooted in the Christian faith
with gaming first (§5). Every session of them is a full neurofeedback session — calibrated, scored like the focus training, saved
with the trainings, counted toward the day score and the streak — with a game on top that borrows
the loops of today's most played mobile games. The app-level design is in `web/DESIGN.md` (§9);
this file records the research behind the games, why these three, and the shared rules.

## 1. What makes mobile games stick in 2025–2026

Figures are third-party estimates (Sensor Tower, AppMagic, GameAnalytics); use them for rank, not
precision.

* **The charts.** Block Blast! was the most downloaded game of 2025 (≈ 368 M) and is still top 3 in
  September 2026; the "arrows" escape puzzles (Arrows – Puzzle Escape, Amaze GO!, Arrow Puzzle)
  took 3 of the world's top 5 install spots in June 2026; merge-2 revenue grew +74 % (Gossip Harbor
  ≈ $100 M a month) and sort/screw puzzles tripled; Royal Match/Royal Kingdom lead match-3 with a
  build meta; Habby's Capybara Go!/Archero 2 lead roguelite choices; Pokémon TCG Pocket made the
  daily pack ritual a $1.6 B business. No game launched in 2026 reached the top-grossing chart, so
  there is no newer core to chase than these.
* **What carries over without ads or purchases:** one rule readable in 5 seconds (Smash Fest's
  "5-second" and "mute" tests); levels of 20–120 s inside 5–10 min sessions; untimed or
  auto-action cores that hide latency; a difficulty roller-coaster with honest near-misses; the
  free-to-play pain points (revives, lives, energy) re-priced in *seconds of focus*; a date-seeded
  daily challenge; forgiving streaks (Duolingo: a 7-day streak makes a return 2.4× likelier,
  freezes lift daily users); collections that are guaranteed to complete (published odds, pity,
  duplicates turned into dust); growth that is ready "tomorrow"; sound and haptics as feel.
* **Ethics, because this is a health app:** no loss-aversion punishment or streak shaming, no FOMO
  timers, no paid randomness, no fabricated near-misses, no infinite loops — "done for today"
  endings instead (peak-end), rest celebrated as part of training, the sensor blamed instead of
  the player when the signal fails.

## 2. What the signal allows (neurofeedback rules)

From 22 fNIRS-neurofeedback studies (Kohl 2020), Mendi studies (Boere 2023, 2024) and the
neurofeedback-game literature:

1. The haemodynamic response peaks 4–6 s (up to ~10 s) after the effort. **The brain drives slow,
   accumulating quantities** (reach, growth, colour, charge); **touch drives anything under 2 s.**
2. **Block designs:** 20–30 s "push" blocks alternate with 20–30 s rest blocks, starts jittered by
   a few seconds and announced by a 3–4 s telegraph. Rest is play, not waiting. Each block is judged
   once, at its end, from its last 15 s.
3. **Adaptive thresholds** keep the reward rate around 60–80 %; beginners get a positive bias that
   fades. About half of people never gain reliable control, so the game must stay fun without it:
   progress mostly from showing up, the brain adds size, rarity and depth.
4. **Never punish the signal.** Motion, poor contact or a new baseline freeze the brain's influence
   at neutral — no reward, no loss.
5. **Overload lowers prefrontal HbO** (three Tetris boards at once did, Boere 2024): touch play must
   stay moderate and self-paced.
6. **Mayer waves** (blood pressure, ~0.1 Hz) pass the pipeline and look like control: smooth over
   ~2 s, use hysteresis and grace, judge over 15 s windows.
7. **Strategies, not "concentrate harder"** (which predicts worse results): imagery, planning,
   mental arithmetic, recalling details. The calibration tips suggest them.
8. **Blind blocks** (no feedback, result revealed after) train regulation that transfers outside
   the game.

## 3. How the three were chosen

Six designers (arcade, cozy collection, puzzle, strategy/roguelite, merge/builder, flow) proposed
twelve concepts grounded in the research above, next to three in-house ones. They were judged on
four lenses — neurofeedback validity, stickiness, feasibility in canvas 2D, and the player's taste
(reward-not-punish, nothing cheap or preachy) — and the set had to be **distinct in world, in core
verb and in the regulation it trains.**

| | Geoda | Latarnik | Motylarnia |
|---|---|---|---|
| Borrowed core | Block Blast (placement, line clears) | one-tap timing (Pop the Lock, Knife Hit), hearts | TCG-pack reveal, Finch-like gentle collection, drawing |
| World | a geode in the dark: prismatic crystals | a Baltic night: a lighthouse beam on navy sea | a sunlit leaf and a glasshouse: paper and gouache |
| Hands do | drag crystals into gaps | tap when the beam crosses a boat | steer a caterpillar across a leaf |
| Focus (push) | grows the fed crystal; steadiness makes it clearer | stretches the beam's reach (far boats carry more) | appetite: faster eating, bolder lines |
| Rest | Szlif: calm polishes the round's best gem | Cisza: calm makes the sea glow and reveals amber | the chrysalis: calm deepens the wing's colours |
| Mendi metric made visible | Control → crystal clarity | Activity → light; Control → extra reach | Activity → stroke width; Control → a satin vein |
| Meta | a cabinet of 9 minerals × 4 tiers | a fishing village, an amber album, letters in bottles | an atlas of 18 Polish butterflies, eggs that hatch tomorrow |

Runner-up: **Przypływ** (an arrows escape puzzle in which your focus is the moon and lifts the
tide). It scored as high as Geoda, but it is also about boats in a harbour, which Latarnik owns.
It is the first candidate for a fourth game.

## 4. Shared rules (the kit)

`kit/focus.ts` turns the focus training's activity % into what a game reads: `level` (0..1, 0.5 at
an adaptive threshold that keeps ~60 % of reliable time above it, never under +1 %), `focused` and
`hold` (hysteresis 1.5 %, grace 3 s), `calm`; `RoundJudge` (a fair verdict for push and rest blocks:
without control either kind passes about two times in three) and `BlockContrast` (push minus rest,
the measure fNIRS studies use, immune to drift). Block games set `adapt: 0.08` so the threshold
does not chase the alternation. Beginners (fewer than three sessions) get a lower floor and judges
that lean further toward them on both sides; their share of time above the threshold stays the
game's own, so rest blocks do not get harder for them. `kit/session.ts` wraps the focus training's session, so each game
session reports the same Aktywność, Kontrola and Tlen numbers; a calibration under 5 minutes old is
reused, so "one more go" starts at once. The runner owns everything around the game (calibration as
the game's intro, countdown, pause, signal banners, the simulator switch, saving, the summary with
the day score); a game owns its canvas, its rules and its progress (`kit/types.ts`).

Every game must make progress with the smoke test's crude input (a tap in the centre every 0.65 s,
Space now and then, the simulator's focus on), so its headline score accrues during play.

## 5. Rooted in faith, gaming first

Emmanuel's games take root in Christian faith, but the game comes first: each core loop is one of
the most played mobile cores and must be fun without reading a word. The faith is the world, its
names and images, its grace, and Scripture at resting points — shown, never preached.

* **Practices as mechanics.** A push block is biblical meditation that fills the mind (picture,
  plan, count, recall), never "emptying" it; a rest block is stillness; the daily challenge is the
  day's bread; blind blocks are walking without seeing; a beginner's gentler judges are the bruised
  reed. The words stay plain: verdicts are named in craft and nature words (leaf, drop, feather,
  glaze), never holiness words.
* **Grace mechanics.** What goes wrong is caught, reshaped or carried — Noah's hand leads an animal
  back, the potter gathers the slumped clay, the parent eagle catches the eaglet, what spills from a
  basket goes to the gleaners. Nothing is ever lost for a bad signal or a bad move, and rest is
  celebrated.
* **Gift and craft.** Grace never waits on the band: every rescue, the base progress and the day's
  gift (the same for everyone who comes, Matthew 20) come from showing up and touch. The band only
  adds craft: reach, depth, rarity, beauty.
* **The band measures attention, not holiness.** No faith meter, no prayer power, no "blessings" as a
  currency, no promise that playing produces faith or an experience of God.
* **Reverence.** No depiction of God the Father; Jesus only indirectly; no cross as an object; no
  angels to command, no demons, no occult or New Age frames, no prosperity promises. Each Bible symbol
  belongs to one game (the dove and the rainbow to Arka, the eagle to Wzlot, the Songs of Ascents to
  Źródła), so the set never repeats itself.
* **Scripture** comes only from `src/content/scripture.ts`, generated and checked against a second
  source in four public-domain editions (BSB, Biblia Gdańska, Luther 1912, Bibel 1917) by
  `web/scripts/fetch_scripture.py`. Every lobby opens with the game's root passage (the registry's
  `root`), and every summary closes with a passage that fits what happened in the session, a
  different one session by session (`kit/scripture.ts` `inTurn`); a game names passages by id and
  never types a verse. The passages load as a chunk of their own (`src/arcade/verse.ts`).

| | root passage (the lobby) | closing passages (the summary, by what happened) |
|---|---|---|
| Geoda | Isaiah 54:11-12 | a rare find: Matthew 13:45-46; a polished Szlif: Malachi 3:3; the cabinet complete: Revelation 21:19-20; else 1 Peter 2:5, Psalm 127:1 |
| Latarnik | Matthew 5:14-16 | a calm won: Mark 4:39; boats home: Psalm 107:29-30, Isaiah 43:2; Psalm 119:105 |
| Motylarnia | 2 Corinthians 5:17 | the atlas complete: Revelation 21:5; a new species: Psalm 104:24; a deep chrysalis: Ecclesiastes 3:1; Matthew 6:28-29, 6:26 |
| Arka | Genesis 8:1 | the dove's leaf: Genesis 8:11; a new kind: Genesis 8:17; Genesis 9:13, Psalm 36:6, Lamentations 3:22-23 |
| Urodzaj | Deuteronomy 8:10 | Ruth comes to the table: Ruth 2:16; a new fruit: Deuteronomy 8:8; the great cluster: Psalm 65:11; a spill: Leviticus 19:9, John 6:12; dew: Deuteronomy 32:2, Psalm 133:3; a new guest: Luke 14:13-14; the day's bread: Matthew 6:11; Psalm 126:5 |
| Wzlot | Deuteronomy 32:11 | a catch: Psalm 91:4; a high climb: Isaiah 40:31; new plumage: Psalm 103:5; Exodus 19:4 |
| Glina | Jeremiah 18:6 | a reshaped vessel: Jeremiah 18:4; a household's story complete: Numbers 6:24-26; a glass glaze: Isaiah 61:3; a calm fire: Psalm 37:7; 2 Corinthians 4:7, Colossians 3:23 |
| Źródła | Psalm 84:5-6 | a stage of the road: Psalm 121:1-2; a river-deep field: Isaiah 35:7; a nest: Psalm 84:3; a closed valley: Isaiah 41:18; green: 1 Corinthians 3:6; a Stream passed: Psalm 1:2-3; Isaiah 58:11, Psalm 23:1-3 |

## 6. The five faith games: how they were chosen

Six designers, each in one genre of the 2025–2026 charts (sort and escape puzzles, merge and
builders, rhythm, cozy craft, physics arcade, tiles and roguelites), proposed two concepts each, next
to four in-house ones: sixteen in all, every one rooted in a Bible story or a Christian practice.
Three judges scored every concept — neurofeedback validity and feasibility, the free-to-play
player's appetite, and faithfulness to Scripture and the guardrails — and the set had to differ in
genre, world, verb, the regulation skill it trains and its part of Scripture, from each other and
from the three earlier games.

| | Arka | Urodzaj | Wzlot | Glina | Źródła |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Borrowed core | Arrows escape puzzles, Bus Jam's landing | Suika's physics merge | Tiny Wings' hold and release | pottery sims, Good Pizza's orders | Infinity Loop's rotate-to-connect |
| World | the ark's deck after the flood, a woodcut | a hillside orchard as an early-church floor mosaic | the biblical wilderness by day, in parallax | a whitewashed potter's courtyard | a pilgrim's relief map, seen from above |
| Hands do | tap an animal: it walks out the way it faces | aim and drop fruit | hold to dive, release to glide | pull and shape clay on the wheel | tap a stone to turn its channel |
| Push block | the Day: focus lays planks (more room on the landing) | Zbiór: focus sends the vine to draw alike fruit together | Lekcja lotu: attention opens the wings; returns are celebrated | Toczenie: an even focus raises the chalk line and trues the clay | Nurt: focus is the springs' flow |
| Rest block | the Evening: the deck sleeps, calm brings the dove's leaf | Rosa: under the linen, calm settles the dew | Wznoszenie: calm strengthens the thermals | Wypał: calm melts the ash into glaze | Sela: the stones rest, calm greens the valley |
| Skill | sustain | down-regulate | recover | modulate (an even level, not a peak) | switch |
| Root | Genesis 6–9 | Deuteronomy 8, Leviticus 19, Ruth 2, Luke 14 | Deuteronomy 32:11 | Jeremiah 18 | Psalm 84, the Songs of Ascents |

The runner-up was **Kłosy** (TriPeaks solitaire in Boaz's field), left out only because Urodzaj took
the harvest; it is the first candidate for a ninth game.

The Games tab now shows the arcade games by kind (puzzles: Geoda, Arka, Źródła; skill: Latarnik,
Urodzaj, Wzlot; creative: Motylarnia, Glina), opens with a **game of the day** (every game in turn,
the same for everyone that day), and marks a game the player has never played as new.
